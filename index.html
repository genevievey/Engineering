            This week i learned the safety and etiquette for engineering class. Always take safety precautions and don't do anything stupid. Yesterday we worked with marbles and pvc pipes to try to take the marble from one end to a bucket on the other. It required good teamwork, strategy, and leadership. I really liked the challenge days, even though my team was ass. This weekend I have tennis practice on Saturday and Imma go out with my friends to the Galleria on Sunday. Prob just gonna sleep between that.

            <br>
            This week I learned engineering dicipline. This includes wearing safety equipment, following all safety procedures, and being responsible. The podject my group started this week was making a Rube Goldberg machine. My group is working on the designing portion. We've covered the first section so far. This week our challenge was creating a home appliance on tinkercad. It was fun even though I had no idea what I was doing.
