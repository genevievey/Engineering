            This week i learned the safety and etiquette for engineering class. Always take safety precautions and don't do anything stupid. Yesterday we worked with marbles and pvc pipes to try to take the marble from one end to a bucket on the other. It required good teamwork, strategy, and leadership to make the marble in. I really liked the challenge days, even though my team was ass. This weekend I have tennis practice on Saturday and I'm gonna go out with my friends to the Galleria on Sunday. Other than that sleep.
